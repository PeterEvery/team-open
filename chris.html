<p>Last year, <a href="http://chriszabriskie.com/">Chris Zabriskie</a> — an <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/chris_zabriskie">FMA artist</a> who specializes in cinematic soundscapes, ambient piano compositions and minimal synth music — found the Attribution requirement so powerful that he decided to drop the NonCommercial clause from his work. In a post entitled <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/member/chriszabriskie/blog/Why_I_Went_CC_BY">Why I Went CC BY</a>, he explained his reasoning: &#8220;There are 48 hours of new video being uploaded just to YouTube every minute. Somebody, somewhere, always needs music for their project. Let people do what they want with your music, and they&#8217;ll promote you.&#8221; His inbox was flooded with requests from fellow creators: &#8220;People with Etsy stores making videos to advertise their new, handmade products. Filmmakers who, while the goal of making their short film isn&#8217;t monetary, one day might press up some DVDs. And if that dude&#8217;s free Flash game gets really popular, he&#8217;ll want to sell it in the App Store.&#8221; He included some examples of work by &#8220;people I&#8217;m not going to sue,&#8221; and <a href="http://chriszabriskie.com/credits/">he keeps a list</a> that now includes big names like the Cartoon Network, New York Public Library, Gizmodo, and Mashable alongside independent feature films and shorts. &#8220;Malleable Objects,&#8221; a short documentary on the artist Margaret Craig, is embedded below.</p>

<p>Zabriskie emailed the FMA earlier this year to describe how his decision paid off in ways he never expected: &#8220;I&#8217;ve scored several feature films, a number of shorts, and am doing a bunch of other contract work for people and projects all around the world.&#8221; Along with the new commissions, &#8220;a shocking number of folks from filmmakers to ad agencies to churches have been paying to license some of my existing stuff&#8221; either as a means to bypass the Creative Commons Attribution requirement, or simply because they have the means to support the music that helped make their work possible. Though he says he has no plans to leave his dream job, (which happens to include both music composition and video editing), Chris Zabriskie has allowed his music to spread freely to the point where he could afford to focus on music full time.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the many models made possible by Creative Commons licensing. Thanks to Creative Commons, creators have choices beyond traditional copyright. Over the course of the past decade, these choices have facilitated collaborations and spawned the creation of countless new works. Happy birthday, CC. We look forward to what the next ten years will bring!</p>
