blurb: He started selling his music when he started giving it away.

<p>Last year, Chris Zabriskie decided to let anyone use his music for free. He licensed all the music on his website under the Creative Commons Attribution license, meaning that directors can legally use it in their movies and videos without asking, as long as they credit him.</p>

<p>Since then, Chris’ music has shown up in dozens of places, even Cartoon Network. And the recognition has gotten him enough paying gigs that he can do his music full-time. In Chris’ words, “You have to think outside the very dusty box if you want anyone to hear what you do, let alone buy it.”</p>
